A self-taught, full-stack python developer with a “Can do” attitude. I am passionate about learning new technologies and architecture to solve problems. Started with being a freelancer in college and led the way to be a senior software engineer in a startup and built a strong technological base for the company.

Today, I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [CubexO](https://cubexo.io). Responsible for several microservices code development and leading the team in various Technology Billings and projects.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with in CubexO!
